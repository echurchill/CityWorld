== Versions

v2.97
* Massive refactor to make CityWorld 1.7.x happy, I hope I found all the regressions. There isn’t a code file that didn’t change in someway.
* Isolated the magic values that are going away soon into a class called BlackMagic, this should make it easier to do the next update
* Due to numerous problems I have replaced the custom tree delegates
* I have removed all of the Tekkit specific code, it was causing a number of problems. I know it doesn’t sound possible but this increases the likelihood that CityWorld will work with Tekkit since it now doesn’t attempt to anything “clever”
* House roofs have been improved
* Farms now include every crop possible, including a few manually created ones
* A lot more foliage types (both trees and plants)
* Isolated buildings and cisterns should now be working again
* Added snowmen to SnowDune world and foliage to SandDune
* Decay now does not include debris that cannot be stack nicely (no more thin glass or carpet hanging about)
* Revamped bunkers and added an official but camouflaged way to get into them
* Added a way for server operators to know when a special lot is generated. Take a look at the output logs.
* Bunkers and tunnels play better with each other
* Started to work on a new world style called Astral but stopped to get this release out
* Still no furniture in the Houses, Bunkers or Sheds, sorry

v2.93
* Tested against Minecraft 1.6.2, Bukkit 1.6.2-R0.1 and 1.6.1-R0.1. It should work against 1.6.2.R1 but generates a lot of deprecation warnings due to their, in my opinion, valid but premature attempt at removing "Magic Values".
* Added [[http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/cityworld/pages/styles/|three more world styles]]
* Added latest Minecraft 1.6.2 materials
* Fixed (and likely added) bugs, one really nasty one made all the isolated buildings in the mountains not generate ...oh yea, while fixing that I added occasional camp sites out in the mountains
* For those who use PhatLoot, with help from Codisimus, I think it works now
* Still no furniture in the Houses, Bunkers or Sheds, sorry

v2.9
* Tested against Bukkit 1.5.1-R0.2
* BETA version of the furniture generators... a lot more to do but here ya go :-)
* Added interior building furnishings
* Added interior building walls
* Added a lot of new stair styles
* Still no furniture in the Houses, Bunkers or Sheds
* Added latest Minecraft materials
* Added **ForceLoadWorldEdit** for those of you who are using beta versions of WorldEdit, set it to true to skip version testing
* Incorporated PhatLoots fixes by SpaceRibs (https://github.com/echurchill/CityWorld/commit/dad7faeb0712243e24be4fac0e73318d4dee2655)
* Fixed some WorldEdit pasting issues
* Fixed loads of other bugs

v2.03
* Now with Reeds!

v2.02
* Incorporated Forge/Tekkit block delegate support by brikeener (http://code.google.com/p/cityworld-tekkit/source)
* Incorporated CityInfo command by Sablednah (https://github.com/echurchill/CityWorld/pull/4)

v2.01
* Fixed a silly glitch that made CityWorld fail if WorldEdit wasn't installed. 

v2.00
* Added support for WorldEdit [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/cityworld/pages/schematics/|schematics]].
If you want to use this feature, you will need to make sure you have WorldEdit 5.4.2 installed.
* Almost every file has changed, I am pretty sure some new bugs have been created while fixing 
other ones but I hope the features now out number the bugs
* Bukkit 1.3.2 happiness
* Added a ruined castle up in the mountains
* Added warehouses (double high single story buildings) in the industrial zone
* Added storage lots (like radio tower bases but with "stuff") in the industrial zone
* Still no procedural interiors, sorry but I think the schematics feature makes up for it for now :-)

v1.32
* Now compiled for 1.6 again

v1.31
* Fixed an issue with MultiVerse (my fault, not theirs)
* Tried to make config.yml a bit more bulletproof

v1.30
* Initial pass of 1.3.* happiness
* Added concept of MapStyle, this only allows for NORMAL and FLOATING worlds right now
* Replaced RoadRange and CityRange with RoadChunkRadius and CityChunkRadius to make things more understandable
* Added CenterPointOfChunkRadius to allow for more flexibility 
* Added ConstructChunkRadius to allow for isolated constructs, like oil platforms and mountain shacks, to be outside of road radius
* Reduced the likelihood of rubber saplings in Tekkit worlds
* Reworked the CityWorld command permissions to separate permissions for traveling to CityWorld vs. creating a CityWorld
* Worked around a strange Chest/Sign casting issue to rarely happens but when it does is bad
* More refactoring and optimization via [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/cityworld/pages/tools/|YourKit]]

* Made the stairs in the mineshafts a little less rickety looking
* Added alcoves to the mineshafts to make the spawners and chests less obvious
* Removed the silverfish from the sewers and mineshafts... yike!, that was a bad idea!
* Oops, sometimes the vertical mineshafts go down beyond the bedrock... double yike!, that was even a worse idea!
* Fixed a buggaboo that made the bunkers plots clear out too much rock and not generate caves correctly
* Incorporated support for Tekkit material types base on initial work by gunre/adept
* If options are used, I put in some sanity checks to make sure all the plots are actually filled with something

v1.03
